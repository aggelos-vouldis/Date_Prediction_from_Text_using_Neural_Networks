# Date Prediction from Text using Neural Networks

This application is developed in the context of the first project for the "Computational Complexity" course

## Technologies used:

- python3
- jupyter notebook / lab

## Description

This assignment's aim is to construct and train an AI for predicting the exact date of an inscription based on its text

## Files Explanation

- data 📁
  - greek_stopwords.json -> a collection of ancient greek stopwords found on aurelberra's repository - https://github.com/aurelberra/stopwords
  - iphi2802.csv -> the actual data on which the Neural Network is going to train and get tested
- exports 📁
  - images -> Loss diagrams of all the tests made
  - pytorch -> Actual results of all tests made in a 5 K-fold cross-validation
